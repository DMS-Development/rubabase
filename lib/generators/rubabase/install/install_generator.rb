                1. Run `rails credentials:edit` to open the credentials file.
                2. Add the following entries:

                   supabase:
                     url: YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
                     public_key: YOUR_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_KEY
                     service_key: YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
                     bucket_name: YOUR_SUPABASE_BUCKET_NAME

                3. Save and close the file. Now your credentials are saved securely and can be used by the 
application. You can start coding ðŸ˜˜
              #{"  "}
              Use actual keys in place of YOUR_SUPABASE_URL, YOUR_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_KEY, YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY and#{' '}
        YOUR_SUPABASE_BUCKET_NAME.\n

        1. The master key is stored in `config/master.key` file, do not commit this file to source control.
        2. Share this key securely with your teammates if they need to access the credentials.#{" "}
        3. In the production environment, you should set this key as an environment variable on the server.
        4. If you lose the key, you won't be able to access the credentials. It's very important to keep it safe.
