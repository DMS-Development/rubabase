# Rubabase

**Status: Active Development** ðŸš§ - This gem is currently under active development and not yet ready for production use. Features described below are being worked on and may not be fully implemented or available.

## ðŸŒŸ About Rubabase

Rubabase is a Ruby gem designed to seamlessly integrate Supabase with Rails applications. My goal is to provide Rails developers with a natural, efficient way to use Supabase, leveraging familiar Rails conventions and features such as ActiveStorage and ActiveJob. Rubabase aims to simplify the integration of Supabase services into Rails projects, making it easier and more efficient to develop with.

## ðŸ”§ Current Features Under Development

- **ActiveStorage Support**: Integration with ActiveStorage to enable straightforward interactions with Supabase storage, allowing for easy file uploads, retrievals, and associations using Rails conventions. *- Mostly done* ðŸŒˆ

- **Singleton Client for Supabase Storage API**: A comprehensive singleton client that provides full access to the Supabase Storage API, catering to advanced use cases that require direct interaction with Supabase services.

## ðŸš€ Planned Features

- **ActiveJob Integration**: Implementation of pre-made ActiveJob classes to streamline background processing and job queuing within Rails applications, for performance and scalability.

- **Supabase Authentication Support**: Future support for Supabase's authentication API, hoping to simplify the process of implementing user authentication and authorization in Rails applications.

## ðŸ›  Project Status

Rubabase is in the early stages of development. Iâ€™m actively working on the core features and infrastructure to ensure a solid foundation for the project. Iâ€™m *very* committed to making Rubabase a robust, community-driven tool that empowers Rails developers to leverage Supabase in their applications more effectively.

## ðŸ’¡ Getting Involved

While Rubabase is not yet ready for production use, I would love to have some community feedback, ideas, and contributions to shape its development. Stay tuned for updates on our progress and how you can contribute in the future.

Thank you for your interest in Rubabase. Iâ€™m excited to work together with the community to build something great! ðŸŒŸ
